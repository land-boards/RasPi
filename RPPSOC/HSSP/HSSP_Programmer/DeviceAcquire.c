/*******************************************************************************
* Function Name: AcquireTargetDevice
********************************************************************************
*
* Summary:
*  Sends the SWD packets corresponding to "Step1: Enter Programming Mode" in the
*  PSoC 5LP Programming flow
*
* Parameters:
*  None.
*
* Return:
*  ack - Variable that holds the status of the SWD transaction
*    ACK response is stored as a byte. Possible ACK values are:
*       0x01 - SWD_OK_ACK (SUCCESS)
*       0x02 - SWD_WAIT_ACK
*       0x04 - SWD_FAULT_ACK
*       0x1x - There was a timeout error in Device Acquire (Indicated by Bit 4 being set)
*              which will happen if the entire step could not be completed in time Ttestmode.
*              Treat it similar to SWD_FAULT_ACK and abort operation.
*
* Note:
*  This function has strict requirements for execution time after generating pulse on XRES pin.
*  It calls the time optimized function Swd_WritePacketFast() to send the SWD acquire packets quickly. 
*
*  While porting this code to your Host processor, try to ensure that very few function calls are
*  used inside this function. The timing requirements for device acquire are documented in
*  the "PSoC 5LP Device Programming Specifications". A execution time optimized code is required
*  to meet these timing requirements.
*
*  This function is called by function EnterProgrammingMode() in ProgrammingSteps.c to acquire
*  the target device and enter its programming mode
*
